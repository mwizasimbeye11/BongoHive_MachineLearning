To install via pip on Mac or Linux, first upgrade pip to the latest version:
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

Then install the SciPy stack packages with pip. We recommend a user install, using the --user flag to pip (note: donâ€™t use sudo pip, that will give problems). This installs packages for your local user, and does not need extra permissions to write to the system directories:
pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib ipython jupyter pandas sympy nose

Linux:
# Consider adding this at the end of your ~/.bashrc file
export PATH="$PATH:/home/your_user/.local/bin"
OSX:
# Consider adding this at the end of your ~/.bash_profile file
export PATH="$PATH:/Users/your_user/Library/Python/3.5/bin"

# Ubuntu & Debian
sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib ipython ipython-notebook python-pandas python-sympy python-nose
